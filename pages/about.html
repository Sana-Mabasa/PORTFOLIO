          <p>
            I am currently studying Mechatronic Engineering at Tshwane
            University of Technology and also enrolled with SheCodes. I'm a
            passionate front-end developer with a love for crafting intuitive
            and visually appealing web experiences.
            <br />
            With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have honed
            my skills in transforming design concepts into interactive and
            responsive websites. I strive to create seamless user experiences by
            leveraging the latest web technologies and following best practices
            in front-end development.

          I have built a weather website.When I set out to build a weather
          website, my goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing
          platform that provides accurate weather information.
          <br />
          By combining my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills with API integration
          and data visualization techniques, I was able to create a robust and
          visually appealing weather website that offers accurate and
          user-friendly weather information. I actively sought feedback from
          users and implemented updates and improvements based on their
          suggestions. I also stayed updated on new features and APIs related to
          weather data, aiming to provide the best possible experience to users.
